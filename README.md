# hello-world
My first repository!

This is a read-me text file in which I'm able to write anything I want about the project. Luckily for me, I think I'm getting the hang of this thing, and
am starting to see the potential. Hopefully I'll be able to learn how to use GitHub sometime soon so I can start looking at cool projects the community
has made, and learn a thing or two about programming!
